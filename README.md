Raphtory is an open-source platform for distributed real-time temporal graph analytics, allowing you to load and process large dynamic datasets across time. If you would like a brief summary of what its used for before fully diving into the getting started guide please check out this [article](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/just-add-time-dizzying-potential-dynamic-graphs) from the Alan Turing Institute!
