Raphtory is an in-memory graph tool written in Rust with friendly Python APIs on top. It is blazingly fast, scales to hundreds of millions of edges 
on your laptop, and can be dropped into your existing pipelines with a simple `pip install raphtory`.  

It supports time traveling, multilayer modelling, and advanced analytics beyond simple querying like community evolution, dynamic scoring, and mining temporal motifs.

Below you can see an example of these APIs and the sort of questions you can ask!

{{code_block('home/example','example',['Graph'])}}

!!! output

    ```python exec="on" result="python" session="home/example"
    --8<-- "python/home/example.py:example"
    ```

### GraphQL Playground
Once you have built some graphs, you can easily host them via Graphql. When you host a Raphtory GraphQL server you get a web playground bundled in, accessible on the same port within your browser (defaulting to 1736). Here you can experiment with queries on your graphs and explore the schema. An example of the playground can be seen below, running a similar query as in the python example above.

### Graph Visualisation and Explorations
Once the GraphQL server is running, you can access the UI directly. If the server is hosted on port 1736, the UI will be available at http://localhost:1736. The UI allows you to search for data in Raphtory, explore connections, and visualise the graph effortlessly.
