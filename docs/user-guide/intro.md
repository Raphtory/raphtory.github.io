# Introduction

This getting started guide is written for new users of Raphtory. The goal is to provide a overview of the most common functionality. For more in-depth examples you can checkout our [example repository](https://github.com/Pometry/Raphtory/tree/master/examples) or go directly to the [library APIs](docs.raphtory.com).

!!! rust
    The rust examples within this guide are currently under development - whilst the general principles discussed are the same between python and rust, you can find code snippets in our [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/raphtory/latest/raphtory/) page.
