# Running the UI

Want a flashy UI to display your Raphtory graph and data? Luckily, we have a UI that you can run from Raphtory with your data.

To run the UI, you will first need to have the server running. To do this, follow the steps [here](../../user-guide/graphql/2_run-server.md). Once the server is running, the UI should be running on the port you have set.

## Search page

The search page of the UI is used to search and filter your data. For example, you can narrow your search by date, graph name and even node properties. You will be able to view a node's direct connections as well as its activity log and history. By double clicking on one of the results, you can navigate to the graph page where you will see a graphical representation of your data. The graph page is explained in the next section.

## Graph page

The graph page of the UI is used to explore your data and graph in an interactive way. Here you will be able to see all your nodes and edges in a clear format, with the ability to delete, expand and so much more.
