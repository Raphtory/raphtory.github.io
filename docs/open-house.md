# Raphtory Open House

Join us once a month virtually for a coffee and to hear the latest news about Raphtory. Our open house session is for:
- Discussion of new and in-progress Raphtory features
- Hearing from researchers who are using Raphtory or temporal networks
- Making requests for new features or functionality
- Temporal graph surgery: get help for bugs or anything in Raphtory you're struggling to get going with

The next event will be on *Wednesday 3rd April at 11am GMT*.
