Back in March [Felix](https://twitter.com/felixcuadrado), [Richard](https://twitter.com/richardclegg) and [I](https://twitter.com/miratepuffin) were invited to give a talk at [AIUK 2022](https://www.turing.ac.uk/ai-uk). AIUK is the UKâ€™s national showcase of artificial intelligence and data science research hosted at the Alan Turing Institute. 

We were involved in the **Research in Action** track as The Turing was one of the initial research funders of the Raphtory Open Source project and we wouldn't be where we are today without their continued support.


We had an abosolutely fantastic time, with great attendence and questions from the audience. The talk has just been made available on Youtube and can be watched below!
