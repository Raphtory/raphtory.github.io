# What are NFTs and why do they have people so excited?

A Non-fungible Token (NFT) is a digital asset which cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, meaning it is wholely unique. This is in contrast to the assets you use on a daily basis which tend to be `fungible`. For instance a pound coin is worth exactly the same as any other and can be freely swapped around without you losing any wealth. 

Despite the memes, NFT's can be used as a variety of items with real world applications, such as: Deeds to a property/piece of land; A domain name (for those old enough to remember the dot com boom); Or, for the focus of this analysis, unique digital artworks. As an example, below is the first NFT, "Quantum", created by Kevin McCoy. 

NFT's are stored on blockchain systems, notably Ethereum, with the `owner` of an NFT being whomever has access to the `wallet` it is stored within. Selling a house certainly becomes a lot less of a headache when all you need to do is send the deed to the buyer's wallet instead of involving lawyers and estate agents.

Anyone, including robots :robot:, can make, buy and sell NFTs. This is usually done via cryptocurrencies on marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) (an Ebay for NFTs) or directly from person to person. 

Since Quantum many NFT artworks have arisen including [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) and [Cryptopunks](https://cryptopunks.app/). This culminated in a boom in 2021 which included the arrival of the [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/), with NFTS reaching a global market valued of [$15.7 Billion](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/05/26/2451426/0/en/The-Global-Non-Fungible-Tokens-NFTs-Market-is-expected-to-reach-a-value-of-USD-122-43-Billion-by-2028-at-a-CAGR-of-34-10-over-the-forecast-period-2022-2028-SkyQuest-Technology.html). 

# Set your tokens to spun

With such large amounts moving around in a seemingly unregulated market this has naturally attracted criminals looking to get in on the action. For instance, a recent crime report from [Chainalysis](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-nft-wash-trading-money-laundering/) revealed that 262 users have been participating in wash-trading their NFTs.

A wash-trade occurs when the buyer and seller within a transaction are the same person or group of people. This is normally done to mislead potential buyers into thinking the asset is worth more, by pumping up the price with each trade, or to make them believe it has very high liquidity, i.e. if they buy it, it can be quickly sold at any point in the future. In reality when they do buy it, they find they cannot sell it to anyone for remotely close to the price they purchased it for. 

The authorities have been hot on the heels of NFT crime, where just last month a former employee of an NFT marketplace was charged with the [first case of digital asset insider trading](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-charged-first-ever-digital-asset-insider-trading-scheme). This won't stop criminals from attempting to make money off NFT's, but it will force them to attempt to better obscure their activities. 

This got us thinking. Network of transactions... occuring over time... complex patterns hidden in large volumes of data... if only we had a tool to let us investigate further :thinking:! Fortunately, Raphtory was at hand to let us dive into the problem. 

## What are we digging into?

With the above premise in mind we set out to see what sort of patterns we could find within the network of trades, specifically focusing on `cycles`. This is when a NFT has been sold by a wallet, but eventually ends up being owned by it again. This can involve a chain of any number of other wallets, take any amount of time, and increase or decrease the price by any amount.

Below we can see an example of such a cycle where `Wallet A` sold an NFT to `Wallet B` for `$50` on Monday, but its back in their position by Thursday, costing them `$750`. They either have serious sellers remorse or, more likely, the same person owns all these wallets and is trying to pump up the price of the given NFT.

*Example NFT cycle across 5 wallets over the course of a week*

This exaple opens many initial questions about the network which we will explore, such as: 
* Do users reguarly cycle NFTs between each other? And if so, is cycling localised to a small number of wallets or is the practice widespead?
* What is the timespan over which these normally take place?
* Can we actually see typical washing practices like `pumping` in action? 

# We have our tools, where's the data?

To answer these questions we used open data from the ["Mapping the NFT revolution: market trends, trade networks, and visual features"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-00053-8) paper. 
This dataset contains 4.7 million NFTs that in total were traded across 6.1 million transactions between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021. 

The data is pre-classified and contains transaction details for NFT sales including the buyers, sellers, type of NFT, price and time. The sales are spread across various tokens and cryptocurrencies, however, in some cases the price data in USD was unavailable. To handle this we filtered the data to those traded with Ethereum where we could obtain the average $ Dollar \rightarrow Ether$ price for the day of the trade. This left us with 2.3 million trades across 3,384 NFTs, an example row of which can be seen below. 

```
| Smart_contract | ID_token | Transaction_hash | Seller_address | Seller_username | Buyer_address | Buyer_username | Price_Crypto | Crypto | Price_USD | Collection       | Market   | Datetime_updated_seconds | Collection_cleaned | Category    |
| 0xd73be..      | 66733    | 0xcdb2c..        | 0xd0c23..      | GorillaNixon    | 0xf6362..     | iMott          | 0.008        | ETH    | 15.4833   | Blockchaincuties | OpenSea  | 2021-04-01 00:05:09      | Block              | Collectible |
```

## Modelling the data 

Prior research has analysed this data as a network of wallets, however, we took a different approach. 
We created a `bipartite graph`, meaning a graph with two types of nodes, corresponding to wallets (addresses) and NFTs. Directed edges $Wallet\rightarrow NFT$ in this network indicate a purchase. 

From the perspective of an inidividual NFT within this model we can see all the wallets which have purchased it, when these occured and for how much. With this information it is trivial to rebuild cycles of any length. 

Below is an example of a bipartide graph. On the left we have Ethereum wallets, the right NFTs, and the edges indicating who has purchased what. Some of these transactions (in green) appear to be innocuous, where as others (in red) are part of a cycle to pump the value of `NFT B`.  

Digging into this we can see that there is a wallet cycle $A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C\rightarrow A$ over the course of 4 blocks, pumping the price from 0.8ETH to 2.6ETH.

  <summary><b>Click me</b> if you want a deeper dive into the model and algorithm!</summary>

<h2> Why do we model the data like this? </h2>
<p>
Cycle detection is a notoriously hard algorithm to run on large networks because you need to track the entire path you have traversed so far. This explodes exponentially with the size of the cycle you are looking for, quickly becoming impossible to calculate. This would be the case if we had to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">follow</code> each NFT along the transaction edges in a network of wallets. 
</p>
<p>
By instead splitting the NFT's into their own set of nodes (as above) we have all of the information on the transactions each has been involved in within the edge lists of the NFT vertex. With Raphtory's time-focused API's we can easily order all of the edges chronologically and then loop through them to find all cycles. This means even if there are cycles involving thousands of transactions/wallets, they are just as easy to detect as triangles.
</p>

<h2> Let's get the data into Raphtory </h2>

<p>
Now we understand our data and know how we are going to model it we can create our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Graph Builder</code>. In Raphtory, GraphBuilders are responsible for turning data into graphs, a little bit like a loose schema. They do not track previously seen nodes and edges as all of this is handled internally by Raphtory. All they require is a parsing function which says, for each row, what is converted into vertices and what is converted into edges.
</p>
<p>
In our data, each row contains a transaction. This transaction states the buyer, seller, NFT, time and the financial cost. We, therefore, want to tell the GraphBuilder that for each row we will take this information and parse it in the following way: 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Buyer Node $\rightarrow$ Generate an  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addVertex</code> update to say we have seen the wallet at the given timestamp.</li>
<li> NFT $\rightarrow$ Generate an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addVertex</code> message to say we have seen the NFT at the given timestamp.</li>
<li> Purchase Transaction $\rightarrow$ Generate an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addEdge</code> message to say the buyer wallet purchased the NFT at the given time for the converted dollar price. </li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
 Note here that the seller is not required as we have all of the buyers (who are going to be the next seller if there is one). The code for this Graph Builder can be found here.
</p>

<h2> What does the algorithm look like? </h2>

<p>
Now we have converted our data into a graph, we can do some analysis using built-in Raphtory algorithms or write our own. Let's write a cycle detection algorithm. 
</p>
<p>
Our cycle is defined as follows:
<ol>
   <li> Alice owns an NFT(cat) </li>
   <li> Alice sells her NFT(cat) to someone else </li>
   <li> After some time, Alice repurchases her NFT(cat) at a higher price than she sold it. </li>
</ol>
</p>
Note: This means we are only recording cycles in which the NFT has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">appreciated</code> in value through the cycle.
<p>
To find these cycles, we: 
<ol>
   <li> Select each NFT and get all of its edges in chronological order.</li>
   <li> List the buyers of these transactions and loop through them in order. </li>
   <li> Track all unique buyers as we loop and if we see one twice go back through the list to build up the cycle.</li>
   <li> Record this cycle for output and continue on where we left off. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
 This process ensures we only have to pass over the data once ($O(n)$) and do not need to record anything until we find a cycle, minimising memory overhead. The code can be seen on github here.
</p>
</details>

# What did we find! :mag:

Lets begin with some simple stats. After running this algorithm we identified 16,673 cycles whereby the user had purchased the NFT at a higher price than before, we can call this an `appreciation`.


## Frequency of profits between NFT trades (over all time)

First, we look at the distribution, to identify how the data is skewed.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nfts/frequency_profits.png)
*Simple appreciations*

Clearly the data is heavily skewed, so a small trim of the top and bottom most 5% shows
that even still the data is skewed. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nfts/frequency_profits_trimmed.png)
*Trimmed appreciations*

The results show that about over 90% of cycles had NFTs appreciate by at most 80 USD.  


## Longest cycle (in terms of users that traded that NFT)

The longest cycle found was an NFT (ID: 108489 of Lucid Sight MLB) traded over 206 times. 
This specific NFT started with the buyer [0xe7387..](0xe738725cdcc41c91f734dd7b5b9659df994d6dda).
This buyer originally purchased said NFT for ~22.68 USD (0.1296 Ether) for the [first time](0x9566c93f3d4ee06fbd20982ce5ea6d7acf64d3f1cf1c74d2dcf450d24052791f) and after 44 days, repurchased 
this NFT for ~26.24 USD (0.1296 Ether). 

But given the large amount of time between their first and last purchase, and the low profit this does not indicate suspicious activity. 

## Highest cost cycles (: NFTs that worth the most profit)

By sorting the data for the cycles with the largest gains, we find that address '0x87' purchased 500 Rarible[6929] for 165 ETH. 
However this is a quantity of a specific NFT.
Upon each transaction, the users each purchase different amounts of this token. 
Therefore the cycle is incorrect, as he later purchases 1020 of this token
which is why the quantity increases. These are multiples of the same token. 
BUSTED.

One of the interesting hops identified is of a user who purchased a Cryptopunk 8033 
for 25 ETH ($48,490 USD), held it for about 22 days before selling it for 45 ETH ($79.459 USD)
and then purchased it back after 6 days for 54 ETH ($95,912 USD).

## Shot evaluation

Looking at the data further, we find that of our 352 traders, 322 traders (~91.48%) had conducted 4 or less cycles of trades. 
10 traders, ~2.84% of traders, conducted between 4 and 14 overall. 
20 traders, ~5.68% of traders, conducted between 528 and 617 cycles overall. 

Lets take a look the top whale in terms of involvement in cycles.

# One of the large Whales

In our dataset we found that trader '0x8acc1421ec98689461ff5777de8ad6648dc6d643' 
was involved in 617 cycles, making a total profit of ~$1,389 USD, with an average profit of $2.25 USD per trade. 

The trader swapped 32 NFTs belonging to Etheremon, Cryptokitties and Mlbchampion.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nfts/whales_nfts.png)
*Whale NFTs*

By looking further into his cycles, we find that the 32 NFTs they traded were swapped between 20 wallets 
across 12,874 transactions. 

By comparing the temporal element, of each transaction within the cycle, we identified that over 88% of transactions occurred within 3.4 hours to 4.6 hours apart. 

For example below we've simplified the transactions of NFT Ethermon #34508 being traded between these wallets. 
We've calculated the time delta between each transaction.

## As a network graph.

If we plot all of the transactions, and the trades between the Whales wallets and NFTs we 
create the graph below.
This indicates a clear connection, seeing that each of the other wallets also traded the other
NFTs in the whales collection. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/nfts/Whale_bipartide_node_to_nfts.png)
*Whale Wallets to NFTs*

## Are there any siblings?

Our dataset consisted of 19 other Whales, Upon repeat analysis we discovered that they too 
followed the same patterns, whereby purchasing and trading NFTs between the same groups of 
wallets, with the same 3-4 hour time window. 

# Future works 
Can we detect the `dump` when it is sold to someone outside the wash Is this money cycle widespread? 
- This work used old datasets 
- Identifying proof of pumps and dumps, so these whales then sell the NFTs to users outside of their community?
