This month, [Ben](https://twitter.com/miratepuffin), [Felix](https://twitter.com/felixcuadrado) and [I](https://twitter.com/narnolddd) were at the [NetSciX](https://netscix.dcc.fc.up.pt/) conference in Porto, Portugal, giving a tutorial at the pre-conference school.

NetSciX is the [Network Science Society](https://netscisociety.net/home)'s flagship winter conference about the theory and applications of Network Science, with academics and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines including mathematics, computer science, life sciences, neuroscience and more.

We had a brilliant time and came away feeling really inspired, also having had some great questions and follow-up discussions from our talk. The talk is up on Youtube and can be watched below.
